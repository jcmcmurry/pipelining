! Purpose of this case is just to ensure that when a solver
! is in all the slave solver slots it is called correct amount of times.
! Here four times for four slots, two scanning iterations, two nonlinear
! iterations i.e. 12 times all-in-all.
!
! Compared to test case SlaveSolverSlots the order of solver indexes is changed.
