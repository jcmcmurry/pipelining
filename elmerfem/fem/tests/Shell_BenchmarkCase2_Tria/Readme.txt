Solve nonlinear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
a cylindrical benchmark problem with bending-dominated asymptotic behaviour in 
the linear regime. The linearized problem has been described in 
Pitk√§ranta et al. Shell deformation states and the finite element method: 
a benchmark study of cylindrical shells. Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics 
and Engineering 1995. 128:81-121. As opposed to the reference, here the shell
problem is treated as nonlinear but the shell is subject to a small load 
so that nonlinear effects are not yet significant.

Results below: The error of strain energy when the shell problem is linear
(Large Deflection = False) and when the mesh is refined as

Element Divisions 1 = 1 16 1  
Element Divisions 2 = 1 8 8 1
