! Falling block of lesser viscosity
! Case defision by L. Kaislaniemi, 11 Aug 2017
! Case solution by P. RÃ¥back, 14 Aug 2017
!
! In this case uniform set of particles that inherit their domain of origin are launced.
! The particles follow the Stokes as passive tracers.
! At at each timestep their total weight for nodes is projected.
! Viscosity is set to be proportional to the two types of particles.
