! Test case for adiabatic compression.
! There is no convection initiated so 
! should obey the adiabatic process pV^g = const.
! where p is the pressure, V is the volume and g is
! the ratio of specific heats. 
! 
! This version is modified from the base example in that the
! a user defined barometric model is used i.e. d\rho/dp is defined in a UDF.
