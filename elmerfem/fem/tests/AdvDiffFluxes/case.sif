! A test case for computing diffusive and convective fluxes.
! Until now the "convective flux" was not suitable for computing fluxes of
! scalar field. Here "flow solution" is assumed to be the field
! carrying the consentration.
!
! One may play with the parameters and mesh density to see their effect on
! conservation of the species.
