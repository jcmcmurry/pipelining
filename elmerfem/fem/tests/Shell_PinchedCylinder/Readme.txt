Solve nonlinear shell equations of Reissner-Naghdi type in the case of 
a benchmark problem where a straight cylindrical shell is subject to a pinching
force and has rigid end diaphragms allowing axial slip. The reference results
can be found in Sze KY, Liu XH, Lo SH. Popular benchmark problems for 
geometric nonlinear analysis of shells. Finite Elements in Analysis and Design
