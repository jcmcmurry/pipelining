!
! 2d patch test
!
! Based on the 3D patch test by Jukka Aho.
!
! Pressure in y direction.
!
! Added rotation and normal-tangential coordinate system. 
! Due to symmetry the rotation only works with 0 and 180 degs 
! but this is no limitation of the N-T system.
!
! This test case uses quadratic elements (of type 408).
