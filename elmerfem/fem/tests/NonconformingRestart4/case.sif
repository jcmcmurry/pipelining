! Perform a restart from a axi symmetric mesh to a 3D mesh.
! a) axisymmetric 2D mesh with TempA: plane.sif
! b) cylinrdical 3D mesh with TempB: case.sif 
! The restart from the 2D mesh requires a dummy solver where the 2D mesh and data is stored.
! Finally we solve a heat equation in the finer mesh using the sum of TempA and TempB as BC.
