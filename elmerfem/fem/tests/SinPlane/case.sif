! A sinusoidal surface attached from one end is subjected to 
! ad hoc forces at the other end.
!
! Reference results, mesh and the problem setting all benchmark from 
! Code_Aster documentation. For complete original documentation see

!
! This test suffers inexplicably from p:1. p:2 works just fine, 
! as all higher count elements.
