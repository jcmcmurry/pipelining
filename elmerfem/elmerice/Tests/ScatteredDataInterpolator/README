Test case to interpolate sparse 2D data sets onto the FE mesh: ScatteredDataInterpolator.F90
---------------------------------------------------------------
data are read from an ASCII file (x,y,variable)
Dec. 2013 : possibility to read NETCDF has been added (if data file has a .nc extension)

Interpolation is made using external libraries
 - nn (http://code.google.com/p/nn-c/): a c code for Natural Neighbours interpolation
 - csa (http://code.google.com/p/csa-c/) : a c code for cubic spline approximation

!! To use the solver :
	- nn and csa libraries must be compiled by the user
	- Go to the ELMER_TRUNK/elmerice/ScatteredDataInterpolator directory
	- Edit/Update the Makefile and compile/install the solver

/!\ -- 
/!\ Only executed if netcdf, csa & nn options are present in the building project.
/!\    NetCDF:     >NetCDF_INCLUDE_DIR<, >NetCDFF_LIBRARY<, >NetCDF_LIBRARY<
/!\    NN    :     >NN_INCLUDE_DIR<, >NN_LIBRARY<
/!\    CSA   :      >CSA_INCLUDE_DIR<, >CSA_LIBRARY<
/!\ -- 

!! The user is invited to get familiar with these libraries by usibg the command line utilities and test case provided with the libraries
