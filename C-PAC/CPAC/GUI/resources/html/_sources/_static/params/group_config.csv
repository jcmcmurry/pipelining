subject_list,A list of subjects to be included in the model. This should be a text file with one subject per line.,"A path (e.g., ‘/data/my_analysis/subject_list.txt’)."
pheno_file,A csv file containing EV information for each subject.,"A path (e.g., ‘/data/my_analysis/ev.csv’)."
subject_id_label,Name of the subjects column in your EV file.,A string.
ev_selections,"Specify which EVs from your phenotype are categorical or numerical. Of those which are numerical, specify which are to be demeaned.","A dictionary with two keys, ‘demean’ and ‘categorical’. Each of these keys has a list as its value, with the names of the EVs that are categorical and which are to be demeaned. For example: {‘demean’: [‘age’], ‘categorical’: [‘sex’, ‘diagnosis’]}"
design_formula,"Specify the formula to describe your model design. Essentially, including EVs in this formula inserts them into the model. The most basic format to include each EV you select would be ‘EV + EV + EV + ..’, etc. You can also select to include MeanFD, Measure_Mean, and Custom_ROI_Mean here. See the GUI instructions for more details.","A formula (e.g., ‘sex + diagnosis + age + MeanFD_Jenkinson’)."
mean_mask,Choose whether to use a group mask or individual-specific mask when calculating the output means to be used as a regressor. This only takes effect if you include the ‘Measure_Mean’ regressor in your Design Matrix Formula.,A string within a list- can be [‘Group Mask’] or [‘Individual Mask’].
custom_roi_mask,Full path to a NIFTI file containing one or more ROI masks. The means of the masked regions will then be computed for each subject’s output and will be included in the model as regressors (one for each ROI in the mask file) if you include ‘Custom_ROI_Mean’ in the Design Matrix Formula.,"A path (e.g., ‘/data/my_analysis/ROI.nii.gz’) or None."
use_zscore,Run the group analysis model on the z-score standardized version of the derivatives you choose in the list below.,"True,False"
derivative_list,"Choose the derivatives to run the group model on. These must be written out as a list, and must be one of the options listed below this table.","A list (e.g., [‘alff_to_standard_smooth_zstd’, ‘sca_roi_to_standard_smooth_fisher_zstd’] )."
coding_scheme,Choose the coding scheme to use when generating your model. ‘Treatment’ encoding is generally considered the typical scheme.,Either ‘Treatment’ or ‘Sum’.
group_sep,"Specify whether FSL should model the variance for each group separately. If this option is enabled, you must specify a grouping variable with the key ‘group_var’.","On,Off (no quotes)"
grouping_var,"The name of the EV that should be used to group subjects when modeling variances. If you do not wish to model group variances separately, set this value to None.","An EV name without quotes (e.g., ‘sex’) or None."
z_threshold,Only voxels with a Z-score higher than this value will be considered significant.,"A list containing a decimal value as a string (e.g., [‘2.3’])."
p_threshold,Significance threshold (P-value) to use when doing cluster correction for multiple comparisons.,"A list containing a decimal value as a string (e.g., [‘0.05’])."
sessions_list,For repeated measures only. This is a list of session names that you wish to include in a single model to run repeated measures or within-subject analysis.  Repeated measures will run automatically if this is non-empty.,"A list containing a session names as strings (e.g., [‘session_1’,'session_2'])."
series_list,For repeated measures only. This is a list of series/scan names that you wish to include in a single model to run repeated measures or within-subject analysis.  Repeated measures will run automatically if this is non-empty.,"A list containing a scan names as strings (e.g., [‘scan_1’,'scan_2'])."
contrasts,The contrasts to be run as part of the group analysis. See the GUI instructions for more details.,"A list of contrast descriptions (e.g., [‘diagnosis+’])."
f_tests,"An optional list of f-test strings containing contrasts. If you do not wish to run f-tests, leave this blank.","A list of strings containing all the contrasts to be included in the f-test separated by commas (e.g., [‘diagnosis+,age+’])."
custom_contrasts,An optional path to a CSV file which specifies the contrasts you wish to run in group analysis. See ‘Custom Contrasts’ section below.,"A path (e.g., ‘/data/my_analysis/custom_contrasts.csv’)."
model_name,A name for the new model.,A string.
output_dir,Full path to the directory where CPAC should place model files.,"A path (e.g.,’/data/my_analysis/output’)."
