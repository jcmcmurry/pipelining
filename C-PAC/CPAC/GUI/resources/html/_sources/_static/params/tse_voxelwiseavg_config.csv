runVoxelTimeseries,Extract the time series of all voxels within one or more ROIs/seeds.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
maskSpecificationFile,"Full path to a text file containing a list of mask NifTIs. Each line in this file should be the path to a NIfTI file containing a single mask. If you only wish to extract time series for newly defined spherical seed ROIs, set this field to None.",A path or ‘None’.
maskSpecificationFileForSCA,"Same as maskSpecificationFile, but used for seed-based correlation analysis.",A path or ‘None’.
voxelTSOutputs,"Extracted time series are written as both a text file and a 1D file by default. With this option, you may also save them out as CSV files or Numpy arrays.","A two-element list, where the first element is a boolean (‘True’ or ‘False’) for whether or not to save out a CSV and the second element is a boolean for whether or not to save a Numpy array."
