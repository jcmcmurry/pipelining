runNetworkCentrality,"Calculate degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, or functional connectivity density.","A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
templateSpecificationFile,"Full path to a text file containing a mask or list of ROIs for centrality. Each line of this file should contain the path to an ROI or mask. If a mask is specified, centrality will be calculated for all voxels within the mask. If a list of ROIs is specified, each ROI will be treated as a node, and centrality will be calculated for each node.",A path.
degWeightOptions,Enable/disable degree centrality by selecting the connectivity weights.,A two-element list where the first element is a boolean (‘True’ or ‘False’) indicating whether or not the weights used should be binarized and the second element is a boolean indicating whether or not the weights used should be weighted.
degCorrelationThresholdOption,"Select the type of threshold used when creating the degree centrality adjacency matrix. Choose 0 for significance threshold, 1 for sparsity threshold, and 2 for correlation threshold.","An integer with one of the following values: 0, 1, and 2."
degCorrelationThreshold,"A threshold value for whichever option from degCorrelationThresholdOption was selected. For significance threshold, this would be a p-value, a sparsity value for sparsity threshold, and a Pearson’s r value for correlation threshold.",A decimal value.
eigWeightOptions,Enable/disable eigenvector centrality by selecting the connectivity weights.,A two-element list where the first element is a boolean (‘True’ or ‘False’) indicating whether or not the weights used should be binarized and the second element is a boolean indicating whether or not the weights used should be weighted.
eigCorrelationThresholdOption,"Select the type of threshold used when creating the eigenvector centrality adjacency matrix. Choose 0 for significance threshold, 1 for sparsity threshold, and 2 for correlation threshold.","An integer with one of the following values: 0, 1, and 2."

lfcdWeightOptions,Enable/disable eigree centrality by selecting the connectivity weights.,A two-element list where the first element is a boolean (‘True’ or ‘False’) indicating whether or not the weights used should be binarized and the second element is a boolean indicating whether or not the weights used should be weighted.
lfcdCorrelationThresholdOption,Select the type of threshold used when creating the lFCD adjacency matrix. Choose 2 for correlation threshold (the only option).,An integer with one of the following values: 2.
lfcdCorrelationThreshold,A threshold value for whichever option from eigCorrelationThresholdOption was selected. This would be a p-value.,A decimal value.
memoryAllocatedForDegree Centrality,Maximum amount of RAM (in GB) to be used when calculating degree centrality.,A decimal value.
