runVMHC,Calculate Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) for all voxels.,"A list where ‘1’ represents ‘yes’ and ‘0’ represents ‘no’ (e.g., ‘[1]’)."
template_symmetric_brain_only,The path to the symmetric brain template from the C-PAC resources. You should be able to use the value from the example configuration. You would only use a different path if using a different symmetric template.,A path.
template_symmetric_skull,The path to the symmetric brain template (with skull) from the C-PAC resources. You should be able to use the value from the example configuration. You would only use a different path if using a different symmetric template.,A path.
dilated_symmetric_brain_mask,The path to the symmetric brain template (dilated) from the C-PAC resources. You should be able to use the value from the example configuration. You would only use a different path if using a different symmetric template.,A path.
configFileTwomm,The path to the FLIRT configuration file for the symmetric template from the C-PAC resources. You should be able to use the value from the example configuration. You would only use a different path if using a different symmetric template.,A path.
