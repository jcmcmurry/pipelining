useSeedInAnalysis,"Which analyses to use the seeds that have been specified in. Can be ROI Average time series extraction, ROI Voxelwise time series extraction, network centrality, or seed-based correlation analysis.","A list of strings, where each string is a different analysis to use the seeds in. Valid strings are the following: ‘roi_voxelwise’ for voxelwise ROI time series extraction, ‘roi_average’ for average ROI time series extraction and seed-based correlation analysis, and ‘centrality_outputs_smoothed’ for network centrality."
